One Liners
============
 * [Do One Thing and Do It Well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well)
 * [Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend.](http://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to)
 * [The Best Code is No Code At All](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-code-is-no-code-at-all/)
 * [Make It Work Make It Right Make It Fast](http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast)
 * Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. - Ralph Johnson
 * [Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.](http://wiki.c2.com/?CodeForTheMaintainer)
 * The cleaner and nicer the program, the faster it's going to run. And if it doesn't, it'll be easy to make it fast. - Joshua Bloch
 * Figure out your data structures, and the code will follow. - William Laeder
 * Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code. - Christopher Thompson
 * So if you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read. - Bob Martin
 * Truth can only be found in one place: the code. - Robert C. Martin
 * What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months. - Fred Brooks
 * As a software developer, you are your own worst enemy. The sooner you realize that, the better off you’ll be. - Jeff Atwood
 * If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter how fast it doesn’t work. - Mich Ravera
 * Unix is simple. It just takes a genius to understand its simplicity. - Dennis Ritchie
 * Code never lies, comments sometimes do. - Ron Jeffries
 * There's nothing more permanent than a temporary hack. - Kyle Simpson
 * In programming, the hard part isn’t solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve. - Paul Graham
 * There is no programming language–no matter how structured–that will prevent programmers from making bad programs. - Larry Flon
 * Most of the biggest problems in software are problems of misconception. - Rich Hickey
 * When you feel the need to write a comment, first try to refactor the code so that any comment becomes superfluous. - Martin Fowler
 * If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. - Edsger Dijkstra
 * The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity, not to create it. - Pamela Zave


Zen Of Python
=============
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
